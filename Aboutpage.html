	<h1>About Walk to Live</h1>
	<p>The Walk-to-Live Walkathon was created as a way for communities of color to take preventive action against childhood obesity in highly affected areas of New York City.  Imani House is an advocate of children learning to eat healthier and staying active. Living healthy lives begins with the formation of healthy habits during childhood.</p>
	<p>Imani House views the prevention and reduction of childhood obesity as a community effort that involves parents, families and schools. The walkathon is a movement to keep the community active and provide an opportunity for community members of all ages to learn about ways to improve their health through exercise and nutrition.</p>

	<h1>Imani House Keeps Kids Active and Healthy</h1>
	<p>For more than 20 years, Imani House has offered programs that address community needs. At the height of childhood obesity rates in New York City, the organization implemented programs to help alleviate the problem. Children registered in Imani House's programs participate in martial arts, dance, and fencing at no cost to their families.</p>
	<p>Imani House is proactive in promoting nutritious eating. We successfully worked with the school leadership team at P.S. 282 in Brooklyn, New York to remove fried foods from the school's lunch menu. Additionally, through our program, children have access to nutrition education classes to learn the importance of maintaining a healthy diet.</p>
